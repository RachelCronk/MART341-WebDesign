 <b>In your README.md file, please do the following:
Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?</b>

The Universal Selectors will select several elements in a page under an umbrella term, and edit their style. For example, I could change all of the text on the page to be blue, or to be helvetica.
An element selctor will be more specific -- you can set the basic rules with a Universal Selector, but add a clause for, say, H1's styles, and all H1 styles would reflect that change.
A class Selector makes it very easy to change one specific part of your page; if you name the About Me Paragraph .aboutme, you can then change that particular section, and that section only. This is good if you have multiple sections of text, and want them to stand out from each other.

<b>Discuss your color palette. How did you choose your colors?</b>
I chose my colours based on a painting I had done a number of years ago, and then threw into a filter on Lightroom! It gave it this nice, muted, deep tone, and brought out the earth colours. I thought the palette would create a grounded, peaceful effect.

<b>Optional: discuss any challenges you faced this week, and how you overcame them.</b>
I had a challenge where the text below my image, which reads "This is the picture I used to find inspiration for the colour palette", was floating below the box that it and the image now sit on. I couldn't figure out how to get the text to be attached to the box, so I just manually increased the height of the box until the text fit. Is there a better way to get text to behave in a certain spot?
