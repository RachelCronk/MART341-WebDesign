                As you grapple with your decision, the lady gazes upon you. Your body freezes, and you feel yourself unable to move.
                 Her mouth opens, and a faint chiming sounds from the hills surrounding. She speaks but no words fall upon your ears.
                  As suddenly as it happens, she disappears, a fading. You are left alone, and a sinking feeling clings to your body. 
                  You close your eyes and feel yourself drifting, falling. You open your eyes and discover you are in your bed, warm and safe.
                   A feeling of unease settles over you. You cannot shake the idea that you are not entirely alone.
