            <h3>The Story</h3> <p>
                You awake to find yourself in a shadowy glen—the sun is descending, and a cool fog of breath rises up as you exhale. 
                You sit up from the cold ground, and rub the dirt off of your simple tunic and leather leggings. Beside you is a backpack,
                a torch and a sword. As you stand, and equip your items, you see that the path ahead of you branches in two directions 
                – to the left, and to the right. The left seems to head deeper into the thickness of the bordering forest, whereas the right 
                seems to bend away from the forest, and towards low sloping, rocky hills.
Do you…
