1. Learning HTML
I have found that I really enjoy coding! I did used to mess around with my blog's coding on tumblr back in the day, so I would say I have a small bit of experience,
but learning exactly what certain things are doing, such as the div and styling the nav is really interesting and fun! I would say I was familiar looking at 
sectional styling, such as dictating the text, heading, and body code within the html part at the top, but that this class has given me a better understanding of how
that is working. There have been a few kinks where I have had to look up something on google or revist the site's lessons for the week, but so far it has been
really fun to learn!

2. Decoration
I am so excited to learn how to make a website look fancy!! I would like to learn how to dictate more complex layouts, such as having a naviagtion bar to the left
and the main body to the right, and fun image effects! What comes to mind is that there is a code to put a gradient overlay over your pictures. I would also very much
like to learn how to have images pop up in fullsize when clicked on.
