Responsive Design can be important, as you cannot guess whether someone will be using their phone, tablet, or desktop. Responsive design allows you to cater to your users needs and provide across-the-board styling rules that will finetune your website to the device it is being accessed on. If you didn't use this, desktop users might be stuck using a mobile site design, and mobile users a desktop-site design, with much scrolling and zooming and pinching to access the content.
