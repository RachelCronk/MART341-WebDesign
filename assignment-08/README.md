What is an affordance?
Affordance is the ability to communicate something that people can grasp easily -- think of Microsoft W--It has the letter W set against a book, which leads you
to believe that it has to do with writing. Affordance is how easily someone can grasp what a button is for -- we all know that a power button signifies that function.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a third-party service like YouTube or Vimeo to host your videos?
An advantage of using a third party to 'host' your video is that it affords you a certain amount of space--not having to manually upload the video to your website would be good if you're on a budget! A downside could be copyright usage -- using a video without permission could lead to some legal trouble. another downside could be if the video was taken down, especially if it was vital to the point of your website, so you would likely have to find another suitable video. Seems like an extra headache that no one needs!


Optional: What challenges did you face this week with this assignment? How did you overcome them?
I was challenged by the video source element -- the two videos I downloaded were both just labeled as MP4, and in the assignment video it seemed like the codecs was much more complex and specific. They seem to play, however, but it is something I looked up on youtube to supplement what I learned in the class. But yes, it seems to work as long as you have the phrasing right--that was another thing I stumbled on. It wasn't working for a bit and I realized I hadn't closed out a quotation!
