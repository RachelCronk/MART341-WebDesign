What is typography?
Typography is the use of specific font families to choose something that aesthetically works with the information you are showing. There are serif, sans serif, and monospace choices -- sans serif is best readable on the web, and serif is best readable for print.

What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?
A fallback font is one that is used if your primary font is not available to the user viewing the page. In your example, you used comic sans, but had a fallback font of Trebuchet MS and Verdana.

What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font?
System fonts are what you have installed on your PC, but this doesn't mean that other people can see them--they would have to have the same font installed. Webfonts are fonts primarily available on websites, but there is a discrepancy between Mac and PC users that must be taken into consideration. Web-safe fonts takes care of that, and provides fonts that work on both Mac and PC.
