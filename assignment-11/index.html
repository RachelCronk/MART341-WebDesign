        The following is an excerpt from my novel, <i>Red Roses, Black Bones</i> :
     </div>
    
     <div class="excerpt">
        <blockquote>"<b>The stag’s</b> dead eyes, sickly green, shined in the afterglow of the lightning strike, and the eerie 
            shamble up the hill left it on stilted, broken legs, like snapping twigs holding up a bloated corpse. 
            She could see the shine of ribs through the chest and left side where the body had rotted through and 
            collapsed away. Mist curled from a peeled-back upper lip, revealing blackened teeth and an unhinged jaw, 
            viscous liquid running out with the rain water, splattering its hide with a slick, oily mucous.
The head rolled back, lolling to one side, and a piercing screech wavered through the night, past the rain, through 
the thunder, until it echoed in her ears, in her whole person, a sound that she couldn’t block out no matter how hard 
she pressed her hands against her head, soaked gloves squeezing water into her curved ears, a sound that she wanted to 
scratch out, to claw at, reverberating and peaking until she couldn’t take it anymore—and then she realized she herself 
was screaming too. Blood ran from her nose and ears freely, through her fingers and the wool of her gloves as she stared
 in disbelief, running down her clothing and staining it in pastels of red. Her knees quaked and she felt a strange 
 shifting of the earth beneath her, a spinning in her head.
There was no time to right herself.
It began to descend the hill towards her, faster now, the crown of broken antlers shining with every thunderclap and immediate
 strike of lightning thereafter, dripping rainwater in a cascade across the bridge of its nose, its teeth spiked and jagged,
  its singular drive ripened with the promise of her death.
She spun and ran, her breath cold in her chest, aching sore as if someone had carved her from the inside out, 
ragged and wet, bolting for the treeline. She ran and ran, mud sinking into her shoes, feet suctioning in the mud,
 but gods, she had to keep going, it couldn’t catch her or else—or else it would—"
