<b>Question 1: Describe the difference between semantic and structural markup:</b>
    <p>Structural markups give information about the structure of the document. This is things like
headings, paragraphs, breaks, and lists. It is visual context for what is happening on the 
page, such as a heading giving you an idea of the topic, paragraphs cutting information up into
digestible sections, a break as a pause between ideas, and lists to quantify information or 
structure information in a digestible way.</p>
<br />
    <p>Semantic Markup reinforces meanings of information. Semantics, by definition, is a branch
of linguistics and logic concerned with meaning. If I were to bold a particular part of a sentence,
"<b>Today</b> is the day I get this done." the emphasis is on today. If I were to bold another part and 
add italics, such as: "Today is <b><i>the</i></b> day I get this done." it reads entirely differently! Semantics help us distinguish intended meaning from a sentence. This includes citations, quotations, links to definitions, or visual cues such as bold, italics, strikethrough, underline, and so on.</p>
