In your README.md file, please do the following:
1. Very briefly detail how browsers function. List any browsers you currently use to surf - or even develop for - the web.
<i>Browsers function by receiving info from a server, and the browser translates it into the page that you view. There is the user interface, what you interact with (buttons, tabs etc.), a rendering engine which interprets the visual information and presents it to you, the browser engine, which mediates between the user interface and the rendering engine and servers. Programming language, such as javascript, requires an interpreter, which most browsers have their own versions. Data storage, like cookies, retains state even if you visit the website at a different time.</i>

2. Link to your screenshot using a relative URL. (We did this last week, too! Check your assignment-03 directory if you can't remember how, you did it).
