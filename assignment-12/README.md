What is the difference between padding, margin, and borders?

Padding is the space that is between your innermost content and the element that houses it. Margin is the space between your element and other elements you include.  It is usually outside of everything else, and can be adjusted to 'fit' your content in a way you would like. Borders encapsulate your content and are adjusted by width and height. The order of these things is usually Margin, border, padding, content, adjusted by height and width respectively.

This weeks assignment went well, although since I was using last week's assignment, I did have some difficulties with link hover properties. I think these is some lingering bit of code that is being finnicky, and I have yet to pin it down. I also had some trouble with a class selector, as it wouldn't show, so what I did was go into the original css and edit the offending block, which in this case was my Title block (it was being cut off by the nav bar, and an extra selector was not impacting the layout, so going into the original and setting the margin/padding accordingly fixed it.)
